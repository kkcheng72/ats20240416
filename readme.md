# Smart Application Tracking System (ATS)

Welcome to the Smart Application Tracking System (ATS). This system is designed to help you improve your resume and increase its compatibility with the job description for your desired position. It uses the power of Google's Gemini Language Model (LLM) to provide insightful feedback and suggestions.

## Overview

The system takes in a job description and a resume, then uses the Gemini LLM to evaluate the resume based on the job description. It considers the current job market competitiveness and provides suggestions to improve the resume's fit for the role. It also assigns a percentage match based on the job description and highlights missing keywords with high accuracy, prioritizing highly relevant skills and experience.

## How to Use

1. Enter your desired position (e.g., junior software engineer, senior AI engineer, etc.)
2. Paste the job description into the provided text area.
3. Upload your resume in PDF format.
4. Click the "Submit" button to get the evaluation and suggestions.

## Sample Files

We have provided a sample job description text file (`sample_jd.txt`) and a sample CV (`sample_cv.pdf`) for you to test the system.

## Deployment

The system is deployed and can be accessed at https://abc.com.

## Note of Caution

Please be aware that this system is primarily intended for demonstration purposes and is not designed for commercial use. It has not undergone extensive testing or fine-tuning to handle a wide range of scenarios. As such, there may be instances where it provides conflicting or inaccurate information. We appreciate your understanding and encourage users to exercise discretion when using the system.
